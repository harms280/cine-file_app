# CineFile

##Summary
CineFile is a web application that hosts a network of users who can create an inventory of media they own and are able to share these various formats of movies, television shows, and other media with others. Users can friend each other and if approved, can view the other person's media collection and put in a request to borrow from the other. The owner can reject or approve the request. The owner is able to view and keep track of who rented what and for how long.
